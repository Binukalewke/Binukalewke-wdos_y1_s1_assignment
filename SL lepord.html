  <h2>Things to know about Leopards</h2>
  <h3>Unique Appearance :</h3>
  <p>Sri Lankan leopards have a distinct appearance with a golden-yellow coat marked by dark rosettes. Their fur coloration is often lighter than that of leopards in other regions, making them easily distinguishable.</p>
  <h3>Solitary Behavior : </h3>
  <p> Sri Lankan leopards are predominantly solitary animals. They establish and fiercely defend their territories, which can range from 20 to 50 square kilometers.  </p>  </h3>
  <h3>Highly Skilled Predators : </h3>
  <p>Sri Lankan leopards are skilled and agile predators, exhibiting excellent climbing and swimming abilities. They are known for their solitary and nocturnal behavior, making them elusive and challenging to spot in the wild. Their diet includes a variety of prey such as deer, wild boar, and smaller mammals, showcasing their adaptability as opportunistic hunters.</p>
  <h3>Endangered Status :</h3>
  <p>The Sri Lankan leopard is classified as endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. Habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and illegal wildlife trade pose significant threats to their survival. Conservation efforts are crucial to protecting and preserving this iconic species.</p>
<h3>Leopard season</h3>
<p>August is the driest period of the dry season in the northern and eastern parts of the island, where all wildlife parks with leopard populations are located. During the dry season, wild animals are facing increasing problems to find drinking water in the parks. In particular, spotted deers, favourite prey of leopards, gather at the few remaining ponds. This is why August is a month of high chances to see the largest cat species occuring in Sri Lanka close to those watering places, too, as these predators are at the top of the food chain. Leopards freely roam in the jungle and open areas of Wilpattu Park  day and night. They prefer open grasslands and sandy areas for relaxing in the dawn and dusk. Since the density of leopards is increased in August, in Yala Park and Wilpattu Park alike, chances are high to observe more than one of these magnificiant animals, which are called the beauty of the Sri Lanka's jungles.

<h3>What Travellers Should Know About Leopards In SriLanka </h3>
<p>The Ceylon leopard or Sri Lanka leopard is a subspecies called Panthera pardus kotiya. Ironically, “kotiya” means “tiger” in today’s spoken Sinhala. At least, the traditional Sinhala name “kotiya” has been used for tigers in recent decades. An unequivocal Sinhala term meaning leopard is “diviya”. The Tamil name of the species is “chirutthai”. The nomenclature “kotiya” for the subspecies was introduced by the first zoologist who described the Sri Lanka leopard scientifically, P.E.P. Deraniyagala. His assumption of a distinct Sri Lankan subspecies was based on morphological differences between India’s and Ceylon’s leopards. Sriyani Mittapala’s recent analysis of the mitochondrial DNA confirmed this assumption.The Sri Lanka leopard is one of seven or eight Asian subspecies of leopards. The genetic isolation of the Sri Lankan Leopard makes it unique. On the island of Sri Lanka, the leopard is the only representative of the genus Panthera, commonly known as “big cats”.</p>
