      <h2>Indigenous Animals</h2>
      <p>Sri Lanka boasts a diverse array of indigenous animals, reflecting the island's rich biodiversity across various ecosystems. Among the notable species are the Sri Lankan elephant, a subspecies of the Asian elephant, revered and endangered, thriving in forests and grasslands. The Sri Lankan leopard, endemic to the island, navigates both dry and rainforest environments. The sloth bear, with its distinctive appearance, calls the dry zone forests home. Unique primates include the purple-faced langur and the toque macaque, both endemic to Sri Lanka. Additionally, the spotted deer, saltwater crocodile, Indian pangolin, and a variety of endemic bird species like the Sri Lanka frogmouth and Ceylon spurfowl contribute to the island's extraordinary natural heritage. Conservation efforts are pivotal to safeguarding these indigenous animals and preserving the ecological balance that defines Sri Lanka's wildlife.
